1)The function _dynArrSetCapacity allows us to shrink the array but when the function makes the data transfer from the old array to the new one there will be some issues. Since the for loop is based on the old capacity it will try to copy data into memory we shouldn't have any access to. It may not seem like an issue but there is potential for something to go awry when a function edits data is shouldn't.
2) _dynArrSetCapacity, and pop need to be modified
3) Breaking encapsulation can be a bad thing because it causes potential problems to arise. In this particular case the array wont resize it's capacity when it reaches the particular ratio of size to capacity.
